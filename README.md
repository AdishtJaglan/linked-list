# LinkedList Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a singly linked list in JavaScript. The linked list supports various operations such as appending, prepending, getting the size, retrieving the head and tail nodes, accessing a node at a specific index, popping the last node, checking for the existence of a value, finding the index of a value, and converting the list to a string representation.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list in JavaScript. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This implementation includes a `Node` class and a `LinkedList` class, with methods to manipulate and interact with the linked list.

## Features

- Append a new node to the end of the list.
- Prepend a new node to the start of the list.
- Get the total number of nodes in the list.
- Retrieve the first node in the list.
- Retrieve the last node in the list.
- Access a node at a given index.
- Remove the last node from the list.
- Check if a value exists in the list.
- Find the index of a node containing a specific value.
- Convert the list to a string representation.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
